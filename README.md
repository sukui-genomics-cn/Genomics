# Genomics
**[Genomics:](https://www.genome.gov/About-Genomics/Introduction-to-Genomics)** It's the operating manual containing all the instructions that helped you develop from a single cell into the person you are today. It guides your growth, helps your organs to do their jobs, and repairs itself when it becomes damaged. And it's unique to you. The more you know about your genome and how it works, the more you'll understand your own health and make informed health decisions.
