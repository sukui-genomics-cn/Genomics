## A puma at large

Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are fund in American. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously . However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt **obliged** to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty mile away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a **trail** of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. 

Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clining to bushes. Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any Zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is distrubing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.

### Voluntary work

In many counties, the goverment help to care for people. Goverment give money to workers like doctors and nurses. Somethimes, when there isn't enough money, more help is need. More hlpe is needed after an emergency, too. Volunteers give this help. Anyone can do voluntary work. Volunteers can be young or old. Many volunteers work with charities that help people all around the world. Some doctors and nurses fly thousands of kilometers to do voluntary work in another country. They work in hospitals or clinics for many weeks or months. They somethimes give vaccinations so that people do not get serious diseases. Every year in the USA, about sixty two million people do voluntary work. About 8 million volunteers are 16 to 24 years old.

**Teaching and others**
People who teach others do one of the most important jobs. Educations helps people to get a better job and to have a better life. Education is important for everyone. When we are very young, we don't know much about anything. Our parents and other people in our family teach us many things at home. Before we go to school they help us to eat, walk, talk and play. They help us as much as possible at the start of our life.

**At school**
School teachers have a very special, important job. They get children ready for adult life. School teachers help very young children to read and write, and to do art and simple mathematics. They also teach older children subject like geography, history, science and languages. Many other people help in the schools. Classrom assistants give more help to children who need it, for example, children who are disabled. In some shools cooks make snacks and lunch for children and their teachers. Playground assistants help children to stay safe when they are in the playground. Sadly, many people in the world can't have a good education. Today, only about 82% of people who are more than fifteen years onld can read and write. 

**At college and university**
Education isn't justf or children. After shool, many young people go to college or university. Some people go to college or university when they are old adults. Others study different subjects at home after work. Professors teach college and unviersity students many subjects - from architecture to zoology. One of the most popular university subjects is law. Professor need to know a lot about their subject so that they can help students to do well and get better jobs through life. One of the biggest universities is Indira Gandhi National Open Unviersity in India. It has about two million students.

**Volunteer teacher **

All around the world, there are volunteer teachers. Doing voluntary work is a wonderful way to see new places and meet new people. Volunteers also help many children and adults to learn information that can help them through their life. Volunteer teachers work in different ways. Some volunteers move to another country to teach there for a few months or years. Others stay in their own country. Maybe they go to a school for just one or two hours a week to help young children with subjects like reading and mathmatics. Maybe they teach teir country's language, for example, French, Spanish or English to people who move there from other country.

Education doesn't stop after college or university. Trainers teach workers new information, for example, information technology or a new language to help them to do their job better. Education really is for life.

**Growing Food**

Some people are lucky because they have many different types of food to eat. In other places, people can't always grow or buy all the food that they need. Many people work to try to provided food for everyone.

Healthy food helps people to stay well because it has lots of important nutrients. When people grow food, they help themselves and other people, too. Some people have a graden or other land where they can grow fruit and vegetables for faimily and friends. Maybe they can't provide all the food that they all need, but they can help.

Farmers grow most of the food that people eat. In Asia, farmers grow a lot of rice, and in Europe, they grow a lot of wheat. In North America, farmers grow a lot of corn. Farmers also grow vegetables like potatoes, carrorts and onions, and fruits like apples, oranges and bananas. Some framers raise animals so that people can eat meat like chicken and beef.



## IELTS 4 - Test 3

Many procedures are available for obtaining data about a language. They range from a carefully planned, intensive field investigation in a foreign country to a <u>casual introspection</u>(临时检查) about one's mother tongue carried  out in an armchair(扶手椅) at home.

In all cases, someone has to act as a source of language data - an informant. Informats are (ideally) native speakers of a language, who provide <u>utterances(言论)</u> for analysis and other kinds of information ahout the language (e.g. translations, comments about <u>correctness(正确性)</u>, or judgments on usage). Often, when studying their mother tongue, linguists(语言学家) act as their own informants, judging the <u>ambiguity(模棱两可, 歧义)</u>, acceptability, or other properties of *utterances(言论, 表达)* against their own <u>intuitions (直觉)</u>. The convenience of this approach makes it widely used, and it is considered the norm in the generative approach to liguistics. But a linguist's personal judgements are often uncertain, or disagree with the jugements of other linguistics, at which point recourse is needed to more objective methods of enquiry, using non-linguists as information. The <u>latter (后者的)</u> procedure is unavoidable when working on foreign languages, or child speech. 

Many factors must be considered when selecting informants - whether one is working with single speakers (a common situation when languages have not been described before), two people interacting, small groups or large-scale samples. Age, sex, social background and other aspects of identify are important, as these factors are known to influence the kind of langue used. The topic of conversation and the characteristics of the social setting (e.g. the level of formality) are also highly relevant, as are the personal qualities of the <u>informants(告密者)</u> (e.g. their fluency and consistency). For larger studies, <u>scrupulous(细致的)</u>  attention has been paid to the sampling theory employed, and in all cases, decisions have to be made about the best investigative techniques to use.
